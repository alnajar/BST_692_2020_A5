BST 692 Summer 2020 - Assignment 5

# Goal
You will make a package called `someWHAT` to document your new function called `some`.
The `some` function will have a manual page and a vignette to show how it works as well as unit tests.

# The `some()` function
+ Write a function called `some()` which takes a vector and returns the total (what could be called the sum of the values). 
+ `some()` should check to make sure that the user passes data that can be used for a sum.  
+ If a user does not pass `some()` valid data it should return easy to understand error messages.

# Include unit tests 
+ Write a unit test that checks to make sure that `some` gives the correct answer
+ Write a unit test that checks that all the errors work properly.

# Documentation of `some`
+ There should be a manual page that explains how to use `some`.
+ There should be a vignette that has a longer explanation of what `some does` and its errror messages.

We will evaluate the package base on:

    + the clarity of the manual, vignette and the error messages 
    + if it passes all the tests for a CRAN submitssionand
    + if it gives the correct answers to our tests
